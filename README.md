A SwiftUI app to scan the QR code of books and save them on your device.

Uses OpenLibrary API to get book details (if the scan doesn't work, it's probably because OpenLibrary doesn't have the book details).

## Motivation

I was clearing out my room, getting rid of a bunch of books, and thought it'd be a shame to donate my books away and forget what I'd read before.
This includes a lot of the books I read through middle, high school, etc. I figured I'm not going to re-read them anytime soon, so someone else might get more out of it.

Anyways, I didn't want to go type up all the books' titles, so I made this scanner app instead to make things quicker and easier :) .

This is also the first SwiftUI app I've made (was working through the 100 Days of Swift course from https://www.hackingwithswift.com/).
